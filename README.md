# Luciano Clementi Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my design and development work.

## Subject

A responsive portfolio website created with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.  
It includes sections for an intro, about me, projects with filtering options, testimonials, and a contact form.  
The layout uses a custom grid system and adjusts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Usage

Start from `index.html`.  
The project cards include category filters such as Front-end, Back-end, Design, Animation, and Video Editing.  
Each card has a “View” button that will link to the full project later.  
The contact page includes a working form layout for collecting user information.
