# Luciano Clementi Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my design and development work.

## Subject

The site is built with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.
It includes a hero section, an about section, a projects section with carousels and interactive elements, a testimonials section, and a contact page.
The layout uses a custom grid system and is fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
The site features custom JavaScript such as a video player, project detail toggles, looping image and video carousels, and GSAP scroll animations.
Model Viewer is used on one project to display an interactive 3D model.
The contact form is handled with PHP. It validates the input and returns a message to the user after the form is submitted.

## Usage

Begin with index.html.
Scroll through each section to see the GSAP animations.
Project cards include carousels and expandable project details.
The video player in the hero section uses custom controls.
The contact page contains a working form processed through PHP.
